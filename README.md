inception engine is a 3D game engine written in ooc.

as stereotypical as it may sound, it's actually quite interesting.

everything's an entity, every entity has properties, properties can be
explored and modified in realtime thanks to the in-game console. it has
a cost in performance but gives a real boost in development time.
